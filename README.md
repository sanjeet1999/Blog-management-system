# Blog Management System
## Project Description

In this project, we have created a Blog management system. In this project, multiple users can create several blogs. And our management system will keep track of all the blogs, along with their creator in a database(sqlite3 table). We used SQLAlchemy ORM to interact with the database (table), make our work a bit easier, and avoid writing complicated SQL commands.
